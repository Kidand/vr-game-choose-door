These Examples were created on Unity 2019.2. 
They seem to be broken on 2018.x builds. 

The Scenes folder has a few examples of very 
basic things using Poseidon. The scenes in there
showcase different things based on the naming in
the hierarchy. 

I apologize if the examples are bit rough. We'll 
make better examples and templates in a future release.
